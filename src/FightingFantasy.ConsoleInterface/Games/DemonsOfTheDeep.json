      "Description": "You are a doughty sailor, a rover of the seven seas. You have many years' experience as a mariner, on great ships and small, on sailing-boats and huge warships. Neither howling storm nor dead calm disturbs you. Your trusty cutlass has slain many brigands and strange creatures of the deep. In port, you keep your listeners enthralled with your sea-stories. Some are true, some aren't... but nobody knows the difference except you.<br> You are five days out of Port Blacksand, first mate on the good ship <i>Sunfish</i>, when the pirate ship strikes. Swooping in on black sails like the wings of some giant, predatory sea-bird, it rams its prow across your decks. Beneath a leering, sharp-toothed figurehead is her name - the <i>Troll</i>. Dozens of ragged pirates swarm across the rails and attack.<br> The crew of the <i>Sunfish</i> fights bravely, but a peaceful merchant ship is no match for a pirate vessel. One by one you see your comrades fall. At last, only you are left. With your back to the mainmast, you lay about you with your trusty sabre, wounding one pirate after another. The pirates back away from you in fear. You drop your guard for a second - but too soon! From behind you, a black-bearded ruffian swings a huge belaying-pin. You see stars... then nothing.<br> When you awake, you are surprised to find yourself still alive. The <i>Sunfish</i>, a battered wreck, is burning nearby. Your comrades' bodies are gone - consigned, no doubt, to the deeps. You are on the deck of the <i>Troll</i>. Its sails snap in the breeze as the pirates head for thier island lair.<br> You try to stand... and find you are tied to the mast. A coarse laugh comes from behind you. 'So... our hero is awake!' The speaker steps into view, and you see your captor - a bald, burly man in a once-elegant purple coat; he sweeps a mocking bow. 'Captain Bloodaxe, at your service! A pleasure to meet such a valiant fighter! I would offer you a place in my crew, but somehow you don't seem quite our type. Whatever shall we do with you?'<br> Several of the jeering pirates begin to offer suggestions: 'Keelhaul him! Run him up the mainmast and use him for a flag! Troll for sharks, with him as the bait!'"
